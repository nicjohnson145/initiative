{"index": 151, "name": "Harm", "desc": ["You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes."], "page": "phb 249", "range": "60 feet", "components": ["V", "S"], "ritual": false, "duration": "Instantaneous", "concentration": false, "casting_time": "1 action", "level": 6, "school": {"name": "Necromancy", "url": "http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/magic-schools/7"}, "classes": [{"name": "Cleric", "url": "http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes/3"}], "subclasses": [], "url": "http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/151"}
